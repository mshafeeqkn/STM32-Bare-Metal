# STM32 Beginner's Guide
This repository contains sample programs for STM32 peripherals, with most examples implemented at the register level. These examples provide a deep understanding of how the hardware is configured at its core. Each peripheral is organized into separate folders for easy navigation. I have also written several blog posts related to STM32 on my website: https://blog.mshafeeqkn.com. Please feel free to visit the site and share your valuable feedback by commenting on the blog posts.
